# Gallery of Retention
A VR-compatible memory retention application constructed in C# using the Unity Engine. The application can also be used within a 2D viewport, such as a regular computer monitor.

## Concept
Players are placed within a makeshift Art Gallery, whereby they are asked to observe the exhibits for a set length of time. They are subsequently asked questions on what they have observed, in an attempt to record the quality of their short term retention. This application represents a substantial piece of supplimentary material created for my 4th year university dissertation/honours project.
